It was a cold winter night and the alleyway was deserted. Kedar walked stiffly towards the warm light coming from the other end.

Kedar saw a girl who was selling matches. This girl sat on the groud and felt so cold. Kedar walked toward her and asked, "would like to sell me a box of mathces?"

Kedar glanced at the girl's face, now illuminated by the light, as he waited for her response. In an instant, Kedar realized it was his cousin who he hadn't seen in several years. He invited her inside and they ate dinner as a family.
